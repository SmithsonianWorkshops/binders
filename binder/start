# A bit of a hack to force the downloaded man pages to source here.
#
# These man pages were a bit difficult to come by. The container by default
# comes "minimized", which means that it doesn't contain text of any licenses or
# manual pages. This does compress the image a bit, but defeats using this as a
# method for instructing folks on how to learn BASH.
#
# The first step was to ensure man was installed via the `ubuntu-standard` apt
# package (which I got from the unminimize command). I used the following
# commands to get the man pages here:
#
#     repo2docker .
#     <CTRL+Z>
#     R2D=$(docker ps -f status=running --format "{{.Names}}")
#     docker exec -it -u 0:0 ${R2D} bash
#     yes | DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive sh -x /usr/local/sbin/unminimize
#     exit
#     docker cp ${R2D}:/usr/share/man .binder/man/
#     cd .binder/man/ && ls -1 | grep -v man1 | xargs rm -rf
#     cd -
#     fg
#     <CTRL+C>
#
export MANPATH="${HOME}/binder/man"

exec "$@"
